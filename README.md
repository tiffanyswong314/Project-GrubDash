# Project: GrubDash

>You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
>As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.

This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation.
To succeed at this project, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:
- Run tests from the command line.
- Use common middleware packages.
- Receive requests through routes.
- Access relevant information through route parameters.
- Build an API following RESTful design principles.
- Write custom middleware functions.
You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

## GrubDash frontend
While it is not required, if you would like to see this project connected to a frontend application, visit the following repository:
![Starter Code: GrubDash Front End](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end)
Instructions on how to get the frontend application up and running are included in the repository.

Again, it is not necessary to connect the frontend to successfully complete this project.

## Project setup
Follow the instructions below to get this project up and running on your own machine:
    - Download the Qualified assessment files to your computer.
    - Run npm install to install the project and run git init to initialize a Git repository.

## Running tests
To run the tests, you can run the following command:
>npm test

## Instructions
Your goal for this lesson is to get the tests to pass.
To do so, you will be creating a server to access two resources, dishes and orders, in addition to error handling.
Your server should follow the structure that you've learned in the program. Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

## Tasks
    1. In the src/dishes/dishes.controller.js file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, and list dishes. Note that dishes cannot be deleted.
    2. In the src/dishes/dishes.router.js file, add two routes: /dishes, and /dishes/:dishId and attach the handlers (create, read, update, and list) exported from src/dishes/dishes.controller.js.
    3. In the src/orders/orders.controller.js file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, delete, and list orders.
    4. In the src/orders/orders.router.js file, add two routes: /orders, and /orders/:orderId and attach the handlers (create, read, update, delete, and list) exported from src/orders/orders.controller.js.
    5. Anytime you need to assign a new id to an order or dish, use the nextId function exported from src/utils/nextId.js
